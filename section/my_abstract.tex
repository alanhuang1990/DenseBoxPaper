In this paper we propose a unified end-to-end object detection pipeline, called DenseBox. Unlike previous work such as R-CNN, which requires region proposal generation, our network can be optimized end-to-end directly on images and predict bounding boxes and class confidence score directly.The carefully designed network works very well on some tasks such as face datecection and car detection where R-CNN and YOLO could be inferior due to small-size object and occlusion. Since DenseBox is a single fully convolutional neural network, it is inherently easy to incorporate multi-task such as landmark localization and semantic segmentation into one network.  We also demonstrate that object detection performance could be significantly improved by incorporating landmark localization.  Our method achieves the best performance on MALF(Multi-Attribute Labelled Faces) detection dataset, and competitive performance on KITTI car detection task compared to method using stereo information.
