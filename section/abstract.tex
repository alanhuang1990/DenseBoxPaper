We propose DenseBox, a unified end-to-end Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) framework for object detection. Unlike previous detection methods such as R-CNN which requires region proposal generation as the first step, our network directly predicts bounding boxes and object class confidences over all locations and scales of the input images. We show that such single network, if optimized carefully, work extremely well in detecting many important objects such as faces and cars, where traditional R-CNN could fail due to the small size of objects and heavy occlusion. Since DenseBox is a fully convolutional neural network architecture, it is straightforward to incorporate multi-task learning. We demonstrate that object detection performance could be significantly improved by incorporating landmark localization during joint training and inference. We present experimental results on public benchmark datasets including MALF (Multi-Attribute Labeled Faces) face detection and KITTI car detection, that indicate our approach is the state-of-the-art system for object detection, outperforming R-CNN while being order of magnitude faster.
