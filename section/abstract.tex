How can a single fully convolutional neural network (FCN) perform on object detection? We introduce DenseBox, a unified end-to-end FCN framework that directly predicts bounding boxes and object class confidences through all locations and scales of an image. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we show that a single FCN, if designed and optimized carefully, can detect multiple different objects extremely accurately and efficiently. Second, we show that when incorporating with landmark localization during multi-task learning, DenseBox further improves object detection accuray. We present experimental results on public benchmark datasets including MALF face detection and KITTI car detection, that indicate our DenseBox is the state-of-the-art system for detecting challenging objects such as faces and cars. 
% We propose DenseBox, a unified end-to-end Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) framework for object detection. Unlike previous detection methods such as R-CNN which requires region proposal generation as the first step, our network directly predicts bounding boxes and object class confidences through all the locations and scales of the input images. We show that such a single network, if optimized carefully, works extremely well in detecting important common objects such as faces and cars, where traditional R-CNN could fail due to the small size of objects and heavy occlusion. Our system is simple and fast enough to be trained from scratch without the need of pre-training.  Since DenseBox is a fully convolutional neural network artchitecture, it is straightforward to incorporate multi-task learning. We demonstrate that object detection performance could be significantly improved by incorporating landmark localization during joint training and inference. We present experimental results on public benchmark datasets including MALF (Multi-Attribute Labeled Faces) face detection and KITTI car detection, that indicate our approach is the state-of-the-art system for object detection, outperforming R-CNN while being order of magnitude faster.
